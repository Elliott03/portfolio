                I'm an IT student on the software development track at the <span>University of Cincinnati</span>, currently set to graduate in <span>Spring 2025</span>.
                I have experience developing full-stack applications, native mobile applications, cross-platform applications, managing databases, 
                and designing complex systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                I worked for Emerson Climate Technologies as a Native Mobile Developer Co-Op, working in <span>Kotlin</span> with <span>Jetpack Compose</span> and <span>Swift</span> with <span>SwiftUI</span> to build proofs of concept from January 2023 - May 2023. <br />
                I worked for Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a Full-Stack Developer Co-Op in <span>Typescript</span> with <span>Angular</span> and <span>C#</span> with <span>.NET Core</span>, working on a data analytics dashboard from August 2023 - December 2023.<br />
                I will be working for Progressive Insurance as a Full-Stack Developer Co-Op in <span>Typescript</span> with <span>Angular</span> and <span>C#</span> with <span>.NET Core</span> from May 2024 - August 2024.
                <br />
                <br />
                Outside of class projects, I created UCReviews, a responsive full-stack application built in <span>Angular</span>, <span>.NET Core</span>, and <span>MSSQL</span> that lets UC students review school housing.
                I also wrote EcoBinary, a native iOS and Android application built in <span>Kotlin</span> with <span>Jetpack Compose</span>, <span>Swift</span> with <span>SwiftUI</span>, and <span>Golang</span> that lets users execute bash commands on their computer from their phone.
